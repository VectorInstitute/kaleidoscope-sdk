A user toolkit for analyzing and interfacing with Large Language Models (LLMs)


## Overview

``kaleidoscope-sdk`` is a Python module used to interact with large language models
hosted via the Kaleidoscope service available at: https://github.com/VectorInstitute/kaleidoscope.
It provides a simple interface to launch LLMs on an HPC cluster, asking them to
perform basic features like text generation, but also retrieve intermediate
information from inside the model, such as log probabilities and activations.
These features are exposed via a few high-level APIs, namely:

* `model_instances` - Shows a list of all active LLMs instantiated by the model service
* `load_model` - Loads an LLM via the model service
* `generate` - Returns an LLM text generation based on prompt input
* `module_names` - Returns all modules names in the LLM neural network
* `get_activations` - Retrieves all activations for a set of modules



## Getting Started

Requires Python version >= 3.8

### Install

```bash
python3 -m pip install kscope
```
or install from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/VectorInstitute/kaleidoscope-sdk.git
```

### Authentication

In order to submit generation jobs, a designated Vector Institute cluster account is required. Please contact the
[AI Engineering Team](mailto:ai_engineering@vectorinstitute.ai?subject=[Github]%20Kaleidoscope)
in charge of Kaleidoscope for more information.

### Sample Workflow

The following workflow shows how to load and interact with an OPT-175B model
on the Vector Institute Vaughan cluster.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import kscope
import time

# Establish a client connection to the Kaleidoscope service
# If you have not previously authenticated with the service, you will be prompted to now
client = kscope.Client(gateway_host="llm.cluster.local", gateway_port=3001)

# See which models are supported
client.models

# See which models are instantiated and available to use
client.model_instances

# Get a handle to a model. If this model is not actively running, it will get launched in the background.
# In this example we want to use the OPT-175B model
opt_model = client.load_model("OPT-175B")

# If the model was not actively running, this it could take several minutes to load. Wait for it come online.
while opt_model.state != "ACTIVE":
    time.sleep(1)

# Sample text generation w/ input parameters
text_gen = opt_model.generate("What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?", {'max_tokens': 5, 'top_p': 4, 'temperature': 0.5})
dir(text_gen) # display methods associated with generated text object
text_gen.generation['text'] # display only text
text_gen.generation['logprobs'] # display logprobs
text_gen.generation['tokens'] # display tokens

# Now let's retrieve some activations from the model
# First, show a list of modules in the neural network
print(opt_model.module_names)

# Setup a request for module acivations for a certain module layer
requested_activations = ['decoder.layers.0']
activations = opt_model.get_activations("What are activations?", requested_activations)
print(activations)
```
